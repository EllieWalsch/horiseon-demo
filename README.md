# Horiseon Demo

## Description

This webpage was built to advertise and highlight the benefits of Horiseon Social Media Solutions. I have added code to meet accessibility standards for clients that use a screen reader. 

## Usage

Clicking the headings in the navigation bar will direct users to the main sections on the webpage. Users may also view semantic HTML elements and alternative image descriptions by opening developer tools (right click -> "Inspect"). 

    ```md

    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

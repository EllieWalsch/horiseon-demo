# Horiseon Demo

## Description

This webpage was built to advertise and highlight the benefits of Horiseon Social Media Solutions. I have added code to meet accessibility standards for clients that use a screen reader. 

## Usage

Clicking the headings in the navigation bar will direct users to the main sections on the webpage. Users may also view semantic HTML elements and alternative image descriptions by opening developer tools (right click -> "Inspect").
